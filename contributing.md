# Contributing to this project

Befor you invest your time in this project, please read the rules below.

## Git
* Please adhere to the git convention of storing line-endings as 'LF' in git.  
  Of course you can configure git locally to use your platform's native line endings, but please ensure that what ends 
  up in the repository has 'LF' line-endings.
* Create your a new branch for your pull request.

## Code Style
Don't reformat the code.
We can discuss code style, but nobody wants to have his code reformatted on a large-scale basis, because
1. there probably is a reason why the code is formatted the way it is
1. you produce a big change set that makes it difficult or at least unnecessarily laborious to determine the real 
   changes.

## Travis
Make sure your version builds without any errors on travis.  
I won't debug your code.
  
## License
You accept that any contribution you make - when being used in this project - will be made available under the license 
of the project (see [README](README.md))
